# CKA Exam Notes ðŸ“˜

These are my notes for the **Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA)** exam. Each section is organized as a directory based on the CNCF exam curriculum.

## Structure

| #  | Domain                      | Directory Name                 |

| 0  | Core Concepts               | `00-core-concepts`             |
| 1  | Cluster Architecture       | `01-cluster-architecture`      |
| 2  | Installation & Configuration | `02-installation-configuration` |
| 3  | Workloads & Scheduling     | `03-workloads-scheduling`      |
| 4  | Services & Networking      | `04-services-networking`       |
| 5  | Storage                    | `05-storage`                   |
| 6  | Troubleshooting            | `06-troubleshooting`           |
| 7  | Security                   | `07-security`                  |

## Tips

- Practice using `kubectl` commands â€” most questions are hands-on.
- Keep your YAML clean and use generators when possible.
- Bookmark the Kubernetes [official docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/home/).
